A thread state. A thread can be in one of the following states:
NEW
A thread that has not yet started is in this state.
RUNNABLE
A thread executing in the Java virtual machine is in this state.
BLOCKED
A thread that is blocked waiting for a monitor lock is in this state.
WAITING
A thread that is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular action is in this state.
TIMED_WAITING
A thread that is waiting for another thread to perform an action for up to a specified waiting time
is in this state.
TERMINATED
A thread that has exited is in this state.
A thread can be in only one state at a given point in time.
These states are virtual machine states which do not reflect any operating system thread states.

WAITING
public static final Thread.State WAITING
Thread state for a waiting thread. A thread is in the waiting state due to calling one of the following methods:
Object.wait with no timeout
Thread.join with no timeout
LockSupport.park
A thread in the waiting state is waiting for another thread to perform a particular action.
For example, a thread that has called Object.wait() on an object is waiting for another thread to call Object.notify()
or Object.notifyAll() on that object. A thread that has called Thread.join() is waiting for a specified thread to terminate.
